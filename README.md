# Linked Data Serverless Proxy
Serverless LD Proxy implemented as FastAPI framework deployed as Lambda function on Amazon AWS. Read more about [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and how to setup [custom domain name](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-api-gateway-domain) for the deployment.

# Installation
Install aws cli and run configuration setup

```aws configure```

Install the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

```pip install aws-sam-cli```

Build LD Proxy image:

```sam build --use-container```

# Create new role for AWS Lambda

You have to set up a role that the AWS Lambda will assume within AWS account and grant required permissions. Go to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), select Roles and Create, and then choose Lambda as the service. Press next and itâ€™ll take you to the Permissions tab, search for lambda and select the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole. Save new role with some name, for example, lambda-demo.

# Deployment on AWS 

Deploy on AWS following the instruction 

```sam deploy --guided```

Go to AWS console in the [APIs section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/apis?region=us-east-1), find function called ld-proxy, to Prod stage and check the Invoke URL, for example, [https://1nrrr3dhei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod](https://1nrrr3dhei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod)

Check if LD Proxy is operational:

```curl https://1nrrr3dhei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/ping```

OpenAPI specification should be available on /prod/docs path, try this:

```curl https://1nrrr3dhei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/docs```

# How to test LD Proxy

You can host your API locally by running: 

```sam local start-api```

Check if API is up and running:

```curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/prod/ping```
